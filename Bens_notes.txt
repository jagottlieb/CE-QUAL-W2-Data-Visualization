Added .gitignore for generated images and gifs
Moved sample files to correct directory
Made file paths linux compatible
Added directory creation for folders if doesnt exist
Added exception handling for pyplot.savefigure() .jpg format error - unsure why Pillow is not resolving this issue
Gif now rendering from .png as well

Future TODO: 
- gif not rendering in order?
